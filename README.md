# Calculator Exercise details:

Create a web app using any language which logs calculations as they happen and shares those calculations with everyone connected to the app.

For example, user A and user B go to your app at the same time. User A calculates “5 + 5”, which equals “10". This is logged below the calculator as “5 + 5 = 10”. User B is updated about this calculation right after user A posts it. Now, user B calculates “3 x 4".This calculates to “12” and displays “3 x 4=12" right below the prior calculation. User A sees this update immediately after user B posts it.

Results should remain between sessions. Only show the last 10 calculations descending from most recent to oldest. The calculator only needs to implement basic arithmetic operations, although you can add other math functions if you would like to impress. But don't forget to meet the basic requirements of the exercise first!

The app must be hosted and deployed to be publicly accessible to engineers at Sezzle so that we can grade the project. The deliverables include both the deployed application and the source code hosted at a site like Github. 











# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
